# [Automating Credit Approval](https://github.com/Natashyatiro/Automating-Credit-Approval)
* Created a tool that predict loan amount and customer’s default based on customer’s age and income to help bank in automating their credit approval process.
*	Optimized and compared Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, GBoost, MLP Regressor, CNN, Random Forest Regressor Optimization to predict loan amount and to reach the best model using Python and Orange.
*	The best model performance is by Regressor Optimization for Random Forest with 2456.62 RMSE in loan amount prediction, and Gradient Boosting with 85.88% accuracy in default prediction.
* Built a client facing API using flask.

# [Casting Product Image Classification to Detect Defective Products](https://github.com/Natashyatiro/Casting-Product-Image-Classification)
*	Created a tool that can classify defect and non-defective casting product based on product images.
*	Built and compared Logistic Regression, Tree, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, Neural Network model using different embedders (Inception V3, VGG-16, VGG-19) in Orange.
*	The best model for this case is logistic regression or neural network with Inception V3 embedders that result in 99.7% of accuracy.

# [Fetal Heart Health Condition Classification in R](https://github.com/Natashyatiro/Fetal-Heart-Health-Condition-Classification-)
*	Created a tool that classifies fetal heart health conditions (normal, suspicious, pathologic) based on cardiotocography data.
*	Optimized and compared e Logistic Regression for Multicategory Y, CART, and Random Forest in R to reach the best model.
* Random Forest performed best out of three with highest accuracy (99.6%) with both a low specificity and a low fall-out value. Not to mention, Random Forest in this study also outperformed models from previous research.

# [Climate Change Dashboard in Tableau](https://github.com/Natashyatiro/Climate-Change-Dashboard-in-Tableau)
*	Cleaned, joined, and aggregated 4 datasets using Tableau Prep.
*	Visualized the data from combined datasets to find patterns and get meaningful insights.
*	Forecasted and visualized CO2 emissions to 2050.
*	Built interactive dashboard using Tableau. You can access through tableau public in this [link](https://public.tableau.com/views/WhoisResponsibleforClimateChange/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).
